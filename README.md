Robo-Speaker is an engaging Python project designed to enhance user interaction through text-to-speech functionality. Created by CodeWithSalty aka Salman, this program provides a simple yet powerful way to convert text input from the user into spoken words using the built-in `say` command on macOS. 

Features:
- Welcome Message:** Upon starting the program, it greets the user with a friendly welcome message, setting a warm and interactive tone.
- Continuous Interaction:** The Robo-Speaker continuously prompts the user to input text, which it then converts to speech, providing an immersive experience.
- Exit Command:** Users can gracefully exit the program by typing 'q', upon which the Robo-Speaker bids them farewell, adding a personal touch.

Usage:
1. Run the Script: Execute the Python script to start the Robo-Speaker.
2. Enter Text: Type any text you want the Robo-Speaker to say and press Enter.
3. Exit: To exit the program, simply type 'q' and press Enter. The Robo-Speaker will say goodbye and terminate.

This project serves as a great introduction to text-to-speech technology, offering a hands-on experience in building interactive Python applications. Whether for educational purposes or just for fun, the Robo-Speaker is a delightful tool for anyone interested in exploring the capabilities of Python and text-to-speech systems.

 How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your macOS.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the script using the command `python robo_speaker.py`.

Enjoy creating and experimenting with your very own Robo-Speaker!
