# RoboSpeaker-MiniProject-python
Robo-Speaker, by CodeWithSalty aka Salman, is an interactive Python program using macOS's `say` command to convert text into speech. It greets users, prompts for input, and vocalizes the entered text. Type 'q' to exit, and the Robo-Speaker will bid farewell. This project demonstrates easy text-to-speech integration in Python.
